    <string name="positives_symptomas">
        If you have mild symptoms, such as a mild cough or fever, you generally do not need to seek medical attention.\n
        Stay home, isolate yourself, and watch your symptoms. Follow national guidelines on self-isolation. \n
        However, if you live in an area with malaria or dengue, it is important that you do not ignore fever.\n
        Seek medical help. When you go to the health center wear a mask if possible, stay at least one meter away
        from other people and do not touch the surfaces with your hands. In case the sick person is a child, help him to follow this advice.

        \n Se medical attention immediately if you have trouble breathing or feel chest pain or pressure.
        \n If possible, call your health care provider in advance so they can direct you to the right health center.

    <string name="negative_symptoms">
        Practicing respiratory and hand hygiene is important at ALL times and the best way to protect yourself and others. \n

      Whenever possible, keep at least a meter of distance between you and others.
        \n This is especially important if you are next to someone who is coughing or sneezing.
        \n Because some infected people may not yet have symptoms or their symptoms may be mild,
        \n you should keep a physical distance from everyone if you are in an area where the COVID-19 virus is circulating.
    </string>
    <string name="recomendation">
        The confirmed symptoms of covid 19 have been 14, but you can be asymptomatic,
        remember to wear a mask and wash your hands frequently
